# Just-having-fun
This entire project was made out for fun for letting me learn a bit more and get better with VB

Here some info to take note with this project:


-Master branch mostly serve to regroup all the edit from Debug Branch and may not be polished


-Debug branch contains all the latest edit straight out of my own pc and can contains error that doesn't let the software work


-Release will only contains the final product for "include version number" wich is polished the best i could for that release.Some known issue may still appear and be corrected later on in a small patch or just in a new release (most likely a new release)

-Debug Branch issue should not be added into issue only master Branch issue should be told
